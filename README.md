# pchs-compsci-project
project JARVIS


list -

agent implementation

voice mode - listen and respond

optional - cool start up screen

control over apps - more than just opening them

get to a point wheree jarvis is actually useful (e.g. jarvis, write an email to ____ saying ____ - or jarvis, bring me to todays AP compsci homepage on canvas)
